/**
 * Shared base for every "what's new" dashboard-card notification — most
 * subclasses announce an admin-side change to a founder (hence the name),
 * but the same shape is reused in the other direction too (see
 * NewRoadblockSubmitted, sent to Admins).
 *
 * Every subclass boils down to the same four things — a headline, a sentence,
 * where clicking it should go, and which icon to draw — so they are declared
 * as abstract accessors here rather than each subclass re-implementing an
 * identical toDatabase(). That also guarantees a single payload shape, which
 * matters because the dashboard cards read these rows directly and would
 * otherwise have to defend against per-type drift.
 *
 * Database channel only for now. Adding 'mail' later is a one-line change to
 * via() plus a toMail() per subclass — nothing else has to move.
