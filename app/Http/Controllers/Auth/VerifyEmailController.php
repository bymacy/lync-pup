     * requires the *currently logged-in* user to already be the same one
     * being verified, which 403'd ("This action is unauthorized.") for
     * anyone who opened the link on a different device/browser than the one
     * they registered from, or whose session had simply expired by the time
     * they checked their email. The route itself sits outside the 'auth'
     * middleware group for the same reason (see routes/auth.php).
     *
     * The signed URL's hash (plus the one-time "token" query param, which
     * only the newest verification email carries — see
     * User::sendEmailVerificationNotification()) is what actually proves
     * this link is legitimate for this user; the 'signed' route middleware
     * already validated the signature/expiry before this method ever runs.
