/**
 * The Rejected tab's manual "Delete" button — an admin choosing to remove a
 * rejected startup before its 10-day resubmission window even runs out
 * (e.g. "did not pass the evaluation" per the Rejected tab spec), as
 * opposed to the automatic removal founders:purge-expired-rejections does
 * once that window actually expires unattended. Deliberately its own thin
 * controller (mirrors EvaluationScheduleController/AssessmentController)
 * rather than folding into the read-only AssessmentHubController or
 * StartupProfileController::destroy() — the latter's redirect target
 * (admin.startups.index) and its "already-accepted incubatee" framing
 * don't fit a startup that never made it past evaluation.
