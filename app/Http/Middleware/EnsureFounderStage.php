 * Founder-side module gating. The founder portal opens up in three stages,
 * and this middleware is the single server-side enforcement point for them
 * (the sidebar's lock icons in components/layouts/founder.blade.php are the
 * matching visual state, and must be kept in step with the rules here):
 *
 *   1. Startup Profile incomplete
 *        -> only Dashboard + Startup Profile are reachable.
 *   2. Startup Profile complete
 *        -> the Information Sheet opens ('stage:sheet').
 *   3. Information Sheet SUBMITTED
 *        -> Meeting opens ('stage:submitted'). The founder needs to see when
 *           their evaluation is booked, and that is what Meeting shows, so it
 *           does not wait on approval.
 *   4. Information Sheet APPROVED by an admin
 *        -> Submission and Readiness Result open ('stage:full').
