/**
 * Makes the admin's cohort selection a single, app-wide thing instead of a
 * per-page query-string toggle: whichever cohort was last picked (on the
 * Dashboard, Founder Applications, or any other module's own filter
 * dropdown) stays selected as the admin navigates to a completely different
 * module via the sidebar, where there's no '?cohort=' in the URL at all.
 *
 * Only touches the session when '?cohort=' is actually present on this
 * request (including an explicit empty value for "All Cohort") — every
 * other request (e.g. a plain sidebar link) leaves whatever was last stored
 * untouched, which is what makes the selection "stick" across navigation.
 * Controllers read the effective value back via session('selected_cohort_id').
