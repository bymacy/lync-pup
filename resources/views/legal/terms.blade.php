            <p>
                These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the LYNC PUP Startup
                Incubation Management System ("LYNC", "the Platform"), operated by the PUP Technology
                Business Incubator (PUP TBIDO). By creating an account, you agree to be bound by these
                Terms.
            </p>

            <div>
                <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-1">1. Eligibility</h2>
                <p>Access to LYNC is limited to founders and startups formally admitted into a PUP TBIDO
                    incubation cohort, and to authorized PUP TBIDO staff and mentors.</p>

            <div>
                <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-1">2. Account Approval</h2>
                <p>Registrations submitted through this Platform are subject to review and approval by
                    PUP TBIDO before full access is granted. PUP TBIDO reserves the right to approve,
                    reject, or suspend any account at its discretion.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-1">3. Acceptable Use</h2>
                <p>You agree to provide accurate information and to use the Platform only for legitimate
                    purposes related to your participation in the PUP TBIDO incubation program.</p>

            <div>
                <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-1">4. Changes to These Terms</h2>
                <p>PUP TBIDO may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Platform
                    after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
