# Tester Setup Guide — Lync (PUP-TBIDO)

This gets the app running on your own machine after pulling the repo. Follow it in order — most "it doesn't work" issues come from skipping a step.

## 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed before starting:

- PHP 8.3 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js + npm
- MySQL, running locally

## 2. Install dependencies

From the project root:

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

## 3. Set up your `.env` file

`.env` is never in git — everyone needs their own local copy.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Now open `.env` and edit the database block (mail is already set up — see below):

**Database** — uncomment and fill in these lines with your local MySQL credentials:

```
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=lync
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_local_mysql_password
```

(Create the `lync` database in MySQL first if it doesn't exist yet.)

**Mail** — nothing to do here. The `MAIL_*` block already has real, working credentials filled in (a shared sending account), so registration/verification emails send immediately, to whatever address you actually register with. Leave that block as-is.

## 4. Set up the database

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

This creates all the tables and seeds ready-to-use accounts and sample data. Login accounts you get from this:

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin@pup.edu.ph` | `password` |
| Founder (Startup) | `founder@test.com` | `password` |

Plus sample startups, coordinators, mentors, and roadblocks across every status/tab, so most screens have data to look at immediately.

## 5. Link storage

Uploaded files (signatures, photos, roadblock attachments, exported PDFs) live under `storage/app/public` and need this symlink to be reachable by the browser:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

Easy to forget, and the symptom is usually "images/downloads are broken" everywhere.

## 6. Word document templates (not in git)

The Word/PDF export feature (`WordDocumentExporter`) fills real `.docx`
master templates that live in `storage/app/templates/`. That folder is
gitignored (`storage/app/.gitignore` blocks everything under
`storage/app/` except `private/` and `public/`), so a fresh clone has an
**empty** `templates/` folder and every export will fail until you add
these files yourself.

Grab **`word-templates.zip`** (all 13 files bundled) from the team drive:

> **Link: `<TODO - paste the shared Drive/Slack link here>`**
>
> (Macy: upload `word-templates.zip` — already sitting in `storage/app/`
> on your machine, gitignored so it won't show up in `git status` — to
> wherever the team keeps shared files, then replace the line above with
> the real link.)

Unzip it into `storage/app/templates/`, keeping the exact filenames:

- `startup-information-sheet-template.docx`
- `startup-tech-assessment-trl-template.docx`
- `startup-tech-assessment-mrl-template.docx`
- `startup-tech-assessment-tmrl-template.docx`
- `startup-tech-assessment-srl-template.docx`
- `startup-post-tech-assessment-trl-template.docx`
- `startup-post-tech-assessment-mrl-template.docx`
- `startup-post-tech-assessment-tmrl-template.docx`
- `startup-post-tech-assessment-srl-template.docx`
- `doc6-startup-growth-strategy-template.docx`
- `doc7-weekly-checkins-template.docx`
- `doc8-prototype-validation-template.docx`
- `doc13-venture-exit-template.docx`

The code matches filenames exactly (see `TEMPLATES` in
`app/Services/Exports/WordDocumentExporter.php`), so don't rename them.

No LibreOffice install needed — there's a `convertToPdf()` method that
shells out to LibreOffice, but it's currently unused (disabled after
`soffice.bin` kept crashing on Macy's machine). Every export just returns
the filled `.docx` directly.

## 7. Build frontend assets

```bash
npm run build
```

(Use `npm run dev` instead if you want Vite to auto-rebuild while you're actively working on the frontend.)

## 8. Run the app

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Then open the URL it prints (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

If you'd rather run the dev server, Vite, and the log viewer together in one terminal, there's a shortcut:

```bash
composer run dev
```

## 9. Testing email verification

Register a new Founder account through the app using any real email address you can check — the verification email actually delivers there (mail is already configured, no setup needed).

## Common gotchas

- Forgot to `cp .env.example .env` at all → app won't boot, or uses stale settings.
- Copied `.env.example` but never edited the DB values → migrations fail.
- Skipped `php artisan storage:link` → uploaded/exported files 404 or show as broken images.
- Didn't copy the Word templates into `storage/app/templates/` (see step 6) → document exports fail or error out.
- Skipped `php artisan key:generate` → "no application encryption key has been specified" error.
- MySQL not actually running, or `lync` database doesn't exist yet → migration errors on step 4.
- Verification email doesn't arrive at all (not even spam) → the shared sending account may have been flagged/locked by Google; let Argee know so it can be reset.
